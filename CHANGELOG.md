## 2.0.4

Documentation changes only. Gave some simple examples of query parameters that can be used to filter the results.

## 2.0.3

`apostrophe-headless` no longer has to be configured before modules it adds APIs to, and it is possible to add APIs to `apostrophe-images` or `apostrophe-files` if desired. Thanks to Stephen Walsh for pointing out the issue.

## 2.0.2

Documentation improvements. No code changes.

## 2.0.1

Added CORS headers. This resolves any issues you may be having accessing the APIs from webpages served from a different host or port number. All modern and even not-so-modern browsers back to IE8 support this solution.

## 2.0.0

Initial release.
